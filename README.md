# Code Louisville
Project for Code Louisville Front End Development - May 2017

A website documenting my recent trip to New York via pictures.

I added a lightbox effect containing captions for desktop users.  This functionality was created using jQuery.  Mobile users can use pinch to zoom so this effect was omitted from smaller screens; captions included directly under each image.

*When adjusting browser width to view desktop and mobile views, refresh browswer so appropriate javascript can run.
  -Desktop view will bring up lightbox with caption.  Press again to exit lightbox.
  -Mobile view will prevent any action from occurring when clicking on image.

# Code Louisville
Project for Code Louisville Front End Development - May 2017

A website documenting my recent trip to New York via pictures.

I added a lightbox effect containing captions for desktop users.  This functionality was created using jQuery.  Mobile users can use pinch to zoom so this effect was omitted from smaller screens; captions included directly under each image.

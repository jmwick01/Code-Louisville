      <h1>More Information about New York City</h1>

      <p>Planning a trip to New York City can be very overwhelming.  Trying to condense so much into a long weekend or a single week can be challenging and down right frustrating.  I've provided links below along with some information that helped us plan out our trip</p>

      <p class="noBorder"><b>Google Sheets</b> - The first thing we did was start an itinerary.  The easiest way to do this was create a spreadsheet via Google Docs.  You can add multiple people to the spreadsheet so its easy to share and collaborate.  Everything is stored in the cloud so you can access the information from pretty much anywhere.  We tracked everything from the attraction, times, which subway stop to get off, and the address and phone number of each attraction.  Not only was this helpful in planning the trip, but it was great to have as we were actually in the city.</p>

      <p><b>Google Maps</b> - Google Maps, or any other navigation app, will be your best friend on this trip.  Most apps will provide directions via walking and public transportation.  This was very helpful in getting us to subway stops and knowing which train to catch.  It also helped out when we wanted to find a restaurant close to our current location.</p>

      <p><b>New York Pass</b> - The New York pass is the key to sightseeing in New York.  It provides information on many attractions around the city.  These range from tours and more historic sites, to entertainment and restaurants.  You pay for the New York Pass based on how many days you want it for.  It's really up to you to see if you can get your money's worth out of the card.  If you plan your trip right you can visit many stops while in the city; and the price of the pass ends up being cheaper than the sum of those attractions separately.  Oh, and the best part is that the pass acts as a "fast pass" allowing you to bypass longer wait times in normal lines.</p>

      <p><b>Instagram</b> - You can find many bloggers across social media, but my wife chose to use Instagram.  We discovered a couple restaurants (Black Tap) that we would not have known about otherwise thanks to food bloggers.  The posts we would see from different users would show us things in New York from people that actually live there and know the hidden gems in the city.  A couple pages we followed were @nybucketlist, @nycfoodgals, @newyorkertips.  I'll link their pages below.</p>

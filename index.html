<!-- Main Information -->

      <p class="col-sm-6">New York - the city that never sleeps. My wife and I learned this firsthand when we took a vacation to the Big Apple
        earlier this year. I had been there before circa 2008, but after almost 10 years the experience you remember begins
        to fade. I was also carrying a flip phone at that time and good luck to anyone who still looks back on the pixelated
        photos from that era. Fast forward to present time and with the latest and greatest iPhone cameras (I have the iPhone
        7+ and my wife has the 6S+) we were determined to view the entire city through the lens of our smartphones. These
        pictures would not only document our experience, but would be shared across social media, shown to our friends and
        family back home, and displayed on our travel wall. You read that correctly; we have a wall in our house dedicated
        to pictures from all of our different travel destinations. Needless to say, our New York photos own the most real
        estate.</p>
      <p class="col-sm-6">To say the city is overwhelming is an understatement. With so many things to do and see, New York has something for
        everyone. From the food and culture, to the sights and entertainment, you can certainly find what you're looking
        for in this concrete jungle. The subway will prove to be your best friend as you traverse the boroughs of New York.
        While there are 5 total - Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island - our trip only took us to three
        of them. You could say we saw a bit of Queens as our plane did fly into Laguardia, but we didn't step foot in Staten
        Island.</p>
      <p class="col-sm-12">Over the next couple pages you'll get to see New York through my eyes. My wife and I took tons of photos as we experienced
        different attractions (both free and paid), ate at some great restaurants, and traversed the subway. I'll do my best
        to bring that experience to you. Also, be sure to check out the More page to find resources that we used when planning
        our trip. Hope it helps you plan out your trip to New York. Enjoy!</p>
